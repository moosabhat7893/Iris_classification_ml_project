# Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into different species using supervised machine learning techniques.

# Objective
To build a model that predicts the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal features.

# Technologies / Libraries
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

# Key Features
- Loaded and explored the classic Iris dataset  
- Visualized Feature plots and decision boundaries using Seaborn  
- Trained model SVM  
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix  

# Results
- Achieved high accuracy (95%+) with Random Forest and Logistic Regression.  
- Confusion Matrix:
   [[16  0  0]
    [ 0 17  1]
    [ 0  0 11]]
